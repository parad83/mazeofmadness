# Maze of Madness

Maze of Madness is a game about being stuck in a maze. Lost, wandering, unsure what to do, you want to escape at all costs.
Will you be able to prove yourself and defeat the curse of this maze, or will you give up like many others before you?

## Time System

You must try to finish the maze as quickly as possible, as to avoid its negative effects wearing you down.

## Map Generation

Each map is unique. With many combinations possible, there is no limit to how much fun you can have.
